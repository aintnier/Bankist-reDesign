Re-Design of Jonas Schmedtmann's app "Bankist"

This is a redesign of the Bakist web app by Jonas Schmedtmann for his JavaScript course. My version includes the following features:
  - Sign up and log in form
  - Home page with the following functions:
    - Transfers
    - Loan requests
    - Movement sorting (ascending, descending, and chronologically)
  - Responsiveness for most screen sizes

This is my first repo.
